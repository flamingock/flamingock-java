## Meet Flamingock 🚀

We are the original authors of Mongock. Over the last 1–2 years we’ve been heads‑down building **[Flamingock](https://github.com/flamingock/flamingock-project)** — a platform inspired by what worked in Mongock, but with a much broader scope: **auditable, deterministic evolution across your whole system**. (A managed cloud offering is also in the works.)

- Covers everything Mongock did for MongoDB/NoSQL migrations **and much more**
- Orchestrates changes across message queues, APIs, databases, feature flags, etc.
- Built with auditability, determinism, and governance at its core

### More highlights
- Flexible/no‑code templates for defining changes
- Native GraalVM support
- Advanced multi-stage workflow
- …and more in the docs → [Features overview](https://docs.flamingock.io/docs/1.0.0/overview/key-features)

> Same creators. Broader scope. Better foundations.

## Why the change?

Mongock focused and helped teams evolve NoSQL databases with confidence.  
But we realized that real-world evolution goes beyond databases: it touches contracts, queues, configs, compliance, etc.  
**Flamingock is the natural evolution** to cover that larger problem space — not a direct continuation, but a new platform that also does what Mongock did.

## What about existing Mongock users?

- Your current versions will keep working as-is.
- We strongly recommend evaluating Flamingock for new projects or when planning significant changes.
- Upgrade help: see **[How to move from Mongock to Flamingock](https://docs.flamingock.io/docs/1.0.0/resources/upgrade-from-mongock)**.

## Thank you 💚

Mongock wouldn’t exist without its community.  
We’re excited to keep pushing the boundaries of safe, auditable change with Flamingock. See you there!
