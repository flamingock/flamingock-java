## Meet Flamingock 🚀

We are the original authors of Mongock. Over the past couple of years, we've been heads‑down building **[Flamingock](https://github.com/flamingock/flamingock-project)** — a platform inspired by what worked in Mongock, but with a much broader scope: **auditable, deterministic evolution across your entire system**. (A managed cloud offering is also in the works.)

- Robust support for MongoDB and NoSQL migrations, covering everything previously offered by Mongock
- Extends beyond databases to orchestrate changes across message queues, contracts, APIs, configs, feature flags, and more
- Designed **from the ground up with auditability, determinism, and governance at its core**

### More highlights
- Flexible/no‑code templates for defining changes
- Native GraalVM support
- Advanced multi-stage workflows
- …and more in the docs → [Features overview](https://docs.flamingock.io/docs/1.0.0/overview/key-features)

> Same creators. Broader scope. Better foundations.

## Why the change?

Mongock helped teams evolve NoSQL databases with confidence.  
But in real-world systems, evolution doesn't stop at databases — it extends to message schemas, APIs, configurations, feature flags, and compliance rules.

**Flamingock was built to support that full spectrum from day one.**  
It’s not a direct continuation of Mongock, but a new platform that also does everything Mongock did — and much more.

## What about existing Mongock users?

- Your current versions will keep working as-is.
- We strongly recommend evaluating Flamingock for new projects or when planning significant changes.
- Flamingock introduces a different architecture, but we’ve made it easy to transition when you're ready.
- Upgrade help: see **[How to move from Mongock to Flamingock](https://docs.flamingock.io/docs/resources/upgrade-from-mongock)**
