## Meet Flamingock 🚀

We are the original authors of Mongock. Over the last 1–2 years we’ve been heads‑down building **[Flamingock](https://github.com/flamingock/flamingock-project)** — a platform inspired by what worked in Mongock, but with a much broader scope: **auditable, deterministic evolution across your whole system**. (A managed cloud offering is also in the works.)

- Covers everything Mongock did for MongoDB/NoSQL migrations **and much more**
- Orchestrates changes across databases, message queues, APIs, infrastructure, feature flags, etc.
- Built with auditability, determinism, and governance at its core

> Same creators. Broader scope. Better foundations.

👉 **Start here:** [Flamingock repository](https://github.com/flamingock/flamingock-project)

## Why the change?

Mongock focused on database migrations (mainly MongoDB and other NoSQL stores).  
But real-world evolution goes beyond schemas: it touches contracts, queues, configs, infra, and compliance.  
**Flamingock is the natural evolution** to cover that larger problem space — not a direct continuation, but a new platform that also does what Mongock did.

## What about existing Mongock users?

- Your current versions will keep working as-is.
- We strongly recommend evaluating Flamingock for new projects or when planning significant changes.
- Migration help: see **[How to move from Mongock to Flamingock](https://docs.flamingock.io)**.

## Thank you 💚

Mongock wouldn’t exist without its community.  
We’re excited to keep pushing the boundaries of safe, auditable change with Flamingock. See you there!
